                Terrament is building long-duration energy storage using gravity batteries deployed deep underground. Our patent-pending design achieves high scale and low cost by maximizing the two simple ingredients of gravity storage: height and weight:

                  Second, we maximize density with modules that support their own weight.

                The Energy Storage Problem
              </h3>
              <p>
                The threat of climate change has sparked action to replace fossil fuels with wind and solar energy. But wind and solar are intermittent resources; the wind doesn't always blow, and the sun doesn't always shine. So without energy storage, our urgent transition to renewable energy will stall.
              </p>
              <p>
              According to NREL, energy storage capacity in the U.S. is <a

                Terrament's gravity storage can solve our massive energy storage demand at an affordable cost.
              </p>
              <p>Our full design is still confidential in early development. However, this early-draft animation illustrates our basic concept. More details to be revealed post-funding.

              <p>
                Terramentâ€™s patent pending design achieves breakthrough efficiency by maximizing the two simple principles of gravity storage: height and weight.
              </p>

              <ol className="list-items">
                <li>
                  Height: We achieve 10 times more height than above-ground solutions. This is solved by digging a mile deep into bedrock (or using abandoned mine shafts).
                </li>

                <li>
                  Weight: We achieve nearly 100% volume capacity with densely packed weight. This is solved with a modular design of self-supporting autonomous units.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                Our solution is low-risk. We use only well-established mining technologies, and we do not rely on any risky, unproven chemical battery technologies.
