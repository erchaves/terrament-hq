              <p>
                Terrament is building long-duration energy storage using gravity batteries deployed deep underground.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our patent-pending design achieves high scale and low cost by maximizing the two simple ingredients of gravity storage: height and weight:
              </p>
              <p>
                <ul className="meet-terrament-bullets">
                  <li>
                    First, we maximize height potential by digging a mile deep into bedrock.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Second, we maximize density with modules that support their own weight.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Our solution is low-risk:
              </p>
              <p>
                We don't depend on critical minerals, and we don't use any chemical batteries. Our innovative system uses only well-established technologies: We leverage the same motor/generators used in wind turbines, and we use the same mile-deep mine shafts which have been built by mining companies for over 50 years.

                The Energy Storage Problem
              </h3>
              <p>
                The threat of climate change has sparked action to replace fossil fuels with wind and solar energy. But wind and solar are intermittent resources; the wind doesn't always blow, and the sun doesn't always shine. So without energy storage, our urgent transition to renewable energy will stall.
              </p>
              <p>
              According to NREL, energy storage capacity in the U.S. needs to <a

                  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grow five times larger by 2050</a> to support wind and solar energy.
              </p>
              <p>
                  But we have a big problem: We don't yet have proven, low-cost technologies that can reach this scale.
              </p>
              <p>Today, nearly all of our energy storage is pumped hydro, which is a <a

                  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly tapped out resource</a>. And Li-ion batteries remain too expensive and impractical to scale up for the entire grid. In fact, researchers are concerned that

                  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> we may struggle to mine enough Lithium for just electric vehicles</a>, let alone to serve both mobility and grid storage.
              </p>
              <p>
                So we need a new solution. A solution which is low-risk, high-scale, and low-cost.

                  Weight: We achieve nearly 100% volume capacity with densely packed weight. This is solved with a modular design of self-supporting autonomous units.
