              <p>
                Terrament is building long-duration energy storage using underground gravity batteries. Our patent-pending design achieves high scale and low cost by maximizing the two simple ingredients of gravity storage: height and weight:

                <li>
                  Second, we maximize weight using modules that lift their own weight.

              <p>
                The threat of climate change has sparked action to replace fossil fuels with wind and solar energy. This transition is urgent, but it will stall without a key ingredient: energy storage.
              </p>

                According to NREL, grid-scale energy storage capacity in the U.S. is <a

              <p>Today, pumped hydro makes up nearly all of our energy storage, but this resource is <a

              <p>Meanwhile, even though Li-ion battery costs are dropping, they are still too expensive. And we don't even have enough raw Lithium material to produce the scale we would need to replace pumped hydro. Researchers are concerned that

                We need a new solution. A solution which is low-risk, high-scale, and low-cost.

              <p>
                Terramentâ€™s patent pending design achieves breakthrough efficiency by maximizing the two simple principles of gravity storage: height and weight.
              </p>

              <ol className="list-items">
                <li>
                  Height: We achieve 10 times more height than above-ground solutions. This is solved by digging a mile deep into bedrock (or using abandoned mine shafts).
                </li>

                <li>
                  Weight: We achieve nearly 100% volume capacity with densely packed weight. This is solved with a modular design of self-supporting autonomous units.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                Our solution is low-risk. We use only well-established mining technologies, and we do not rely on any risky, unproven chemical battery technologies.
