                Mission Statements
              </h2>
              <p>
                Terrament's mission is building high-impact solutions to mitigate climate damage.
              </p>
              <p>
                Terrament was born out of an urgent call to action: that society can, and must, mitigate the catastrophic costs of <a
                  href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/what-evidence-exists-earth-warming-and-humans-are-main-cause"
                  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >human-caused</a> climate damage, and that we must do so justly.
              </p>

                Just Transition
              </h2>
              <p>
                Terrament acknowledges that climate costs are wide-reaching including human costs, environmental costs, and financial costs. Society cannot afford to ignore climate threats.
              </p>
              <p>
                We acknowledge that climate damage impacts society unjustly; populations who cause more climate damage often feel less impacts, and vice versa.
              </p>
              <p>
                To mitigate climate damage, society must transition to a safer, more sustainable, and more just energy infrastructure. A just transition requires that no one is left behind to endure unjust hardship, and that no one is disenfranchised from the energy transitionâ€™s wealth of opportunity.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that a healthy economy and a clean environment can and should co-exist. We believe this is possible without costing workers or community residents their health, environment, jobs, or economic assets. And we understand that a just transition is only possible if the organizations working towards it are also just and inclusive.
